% Evolution is deeply history-driven, but we lack understanding in what role history plays in an evolving population.
% %Evolution is deeply history-driven, and thus improving our understanding of the role of historical contingency in evolution can transform our evolutionary thinking, particularly in the case of long-term outcomes. 
% While recent work has begun the journey of better understanding the role of history in evolution, here I demonstrate that digital evolution is poised to not just illuminate the intricacies of historical contingency and potentiation dynamics, but to refine our tools for conducting these studies in natural systems. 

% Whether we want to predict future evolution or analyze the past, we must first improve our understanding of the role that history plays in producing evolutionary outcomes.
% For us to understand the dynamics of evolution, whether retrospective or predictive, we must...

% The role that history plays in evolutionary dynamics must be considered if we wish to understand life both \textit{as it is} and \textit{how it may be}.

% We must better understand the historically contingent nature of evolution if we...

% Our lack of understanding in the actual role that history plays in an evolving population significantly hinders both our ability to understand the dynamics of what has previously evolved and to predict future evolution. 
% For us to understand the dynamics of evolution, both past and future, we must first improve our understanding of the role that history plays in producing evolutionary outcomes.

% For us to discern the progression of life on Earth and predict its future, we must first improve our understanding of evolutionary dynamics and, by necessity, the role that history plays in producing evolutionary outcomes.

% Evolutionary theory helps us reconstruct the natural history of living systems, as well as predict their future.  
% Advancement of this theory, however, requires us to understand how past events result in particular evolutionary outcomes.
%By leveraging experimental evolution, and digital evolution in particular, we can begin asking these important questions and disentangling exactly what role history played in the evolution of a particular population. 
%By conducting computational studies we can illuminate the role that history plays in evolving populations, while refining the techniques to be used on natural organisms.
%Computational systems allow us to %scale up investigations into evolutionary dynamics, allowing us to 
%easily replay the evolution of populations many times to illuminate the range of expected outcomes and how this distribution changes over time thus the role that history played in these populations.
%Such rapid prototyping allows us to evaluate research strategies and simplify them for application back to living organisms.
The core thesis of this dissertation is two-part: 
1) advancement of evolutionary theory requires us to understand how past events result in particular evolutionary outcomes, and
2) computational systems make large-scale replay experiments feasible and allow us to empirically test the role that history played in evolved populations. 
This rapid experimentation in computational systems allows us to both improve our theoretical understanding of the role of historical contingency in evolution and to refine the methodologies of these experiments, which can then be leveraged in future wet-lab studies. 
%replay the evolution of populations many times from various points in the population's history. 
%These replays illuminate how the distribution of expected outcomes shifts over time and thus the role that history played in these evolving populations. 
%Such rapid prototyping allows us to evaluate research strategies and simplify them for application back to living organisms.

% Things to get at: 
    % 1. Prediction vs understanding the past
    % 2. We can run MANY replays in silico
    % 3. The ideas/techniques can be translated back to wetlab studies
    % 4. History in evolution is... important!
