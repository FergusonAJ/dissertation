- Recap our main takeaways
    - A population's history can have a dramatic effect on its evolutionary future
    - Digital evolution is perfect for ``prototyping'' these studies and techniques

- Future work
    - On the multiplicative nature of potentiation

    - Evolvability and other metrics
        - e.g., what do changes in long-term variation mean? 
            - Is this another form of evolvability? 
            
    - Are there other characteristics of potentiating mutations worth identifying?
        - E.g., can we identify directness of epistasis? Gateway mutations?
