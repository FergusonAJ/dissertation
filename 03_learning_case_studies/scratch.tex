\section{Intro}

% Setup - Complexity is everywhere, yet the evolutionary pathways to complexity have stumped researchers for ages
While complex life is all around us today, what evolutionary pathways did life take to create such complex traits and behaviors?
Is increasing complexity an inevitable outcome of evolution, or did lucky mutations make all the difference?
Here we ask: after a complex behavior has evolved, how did the probability of evolving that behavior change over the lineage?
Did the likelihood of evolving the complex behavior steadily increase over time, or did certain mutations cause the likelihood to jump?

% General evolution of complexity background
% Mention the idea of neutral and deleterious mutations being beneficial in the long run
The evolution of complexity has been a focal point of evolutionary biology research for years. 
Researchers have tried numerous techniques for teasing apart the what causes complexity to arise.
