% If your system does not generate letter format documents by default,

% latex example ; latex example
% dvips -o example.ps -t letterSize example.dvi
% ps2pdf example.ps example.pdf


% For pdflatex users:
% The alifeconf style file loads the "graphicx" package, and
% this may lead some users of pdflatex to experience problems.
% These can be fixed by editing the alifeconf.sty file to specify:
% \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
%   instead of
% \usepackage{graphicx}.
% The PDF output generated by pdflatex should match the required

\noindent This chapter is adapted from \citep{fergusonPotentiatingMutationsFacilitate2023}, which was peer-reviewed and published in the proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Artificial Life. 

In this work we use analytic replay experiments to quantify how the probability of evolving associative learning (i.e., its potentiation) changes over the course of evolved digital lineages. 
Specifically, we replay four case study lineages that successfully evolved learning. 
We find that potentiation can increase suddenly and identify ``potentiating mutations'' in each lineage that substantially increase potentiation in a single generation. 
We then dive into the mechanics of these mutations and how they interact with later mutations to confer associative learning.
