  abstract = {A method of analysis of a local fitness landscape for a current biopolymer is presented. Based on the assumption of additivity of mutational effects in the biopolymer, we assigned a site-fitness to each residue at each site. The assigned values of site-fitnesses were obtained by the least-squares method to minimize discrepancies between experimental fitnesses and theoretical ones. As test cases, we analyzed a section of a local landscape for the thermostability of prolyl endopeptidase and that for the enzymatic activity of thermolysin. These sections were proved to be of the rough Mt. Fuji-type with {\texttheta} values of larger than 1.0, where {\texttheta} is defined as the ratio of the ``mean slope'' to the ``degree of roughness'' on the fitness surface. Furthermore, we theoretically explained discrepancies between the fitnesses of multiple mutants and those predicted based on strict additivity of the component mutations by using a model of the rough Mt. Fuji-type landscape. According to this model, the discrepancies depend on the local landscape property (such as the {\texttheta} value) and the location of the wild type on the landscape and the mean change in fitness by the component mutations. Our results suggest that this model may provide a good approximation of real sections of local landscapes for current biopolymers phenomenologically.{\copyright} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract = {Bats (order Chiroptera) are the only mammals capable of powered flight, and this may be an important factor behind their rapid diversification into the over 1400 species that exist today -- around a quarter of all mammalian species. Though flight in bats has been extensively studied, the evolutionary history of the ability to fly in the chiropterans remains unclear. We provide an updated synthesis of current understanding of the mechanics of flight in bats (from skeleton to metabolism), its relation to echolocation, and where previously articulated evolutionary hypotheses for the development of flight in bats stand following recent empirical advances. We consider the gliding model, and the echolocation-first, flight-first, tandem development, and diurnal frugivore hypotheses. In the light of the recently published description of the web-winged dinosaur Ambopteryx longibrachium, we draw together all the current evidence into a novel hypothesis. We present the interdigital webbing hypothesis: the ancestral bat exhibited interdigital webbing prior to powered flight ability, and the Yangochiroptera, Pteropodidae, and Rhinolophoidea evolved into their current forms along parallel trajectories from this common ancestor. Thus, we suggest that powered flight may have evolved multiple times within the Chiroptera and that similarity in wing morphology in different lineages is driven by convergence from a common ancestor with interdigital webbing.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Pleiotropic fitness trade-offs and their opposite, buttressing pleiotropy, underlie many important phenomena in ecology and evolution. Yet, predicting whether a population adapting to one ("home") environment will concomitantly gain or lose fitness in another ("non-home") environment remains challenging, especially when adaptive mutations have diverse pleiotropic effects. Here, we address this problem using the concept of the joint distribution of fitness effects (JDFE), a local measurable property of the fitness landscape. We derive simple statistics of the JDFE that predict the expected slope, variance and covariance of non-home fitness trajectories. We estimate these statistics from published data from the \emph{Escherichia coli} knock-out collection in the presence of antibiotics. We find that, for some drug pairs, the average trend towards collateral sensitivity may be masked by large uncertainty, even in the absence of epistasis. We provide simple theoretically grounded guidelines for designing robust sequential drug protocols.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Evolution is the hallmark of life. Descriptions of the evolution of microorganisms have provided a wealth of information, but knowledge regarding ``what happened'' has precluded a deeper understanding of ``how'' evolution has proceeded, as in the case of antimicrobial resistance. The difficulty in answering the ``how'' question lies in the multihierarchical dimensions of evolutionary processes, nested in complex networks, encompassing all units of selection, from genes to communities and ecosystems. At the simplest ontological level (as resistance genes), evolution proceeds by random (mutation and drift) and directional (natural selection) processes; however, sequential pathways of adaptive variation can occasionally be observed, and under fixed circumstances (particular fitness landscapes), evolution is predictable. At the highest level (such as that of plasmids, clones, species, microbiotas), the systems' degrees of freedom increase dramatically, related to the variable dispersal, fragmentation, relatedness, or coalescence of bacterial populations, depending on heterogeneous and changing niches and selective gradients in complex environments. Evolutionary trajectories of antibiotic resistance find their way in these changing landscapes subjected to random variations, becoming highly entropic and therefore unpredictable. However, experimental, phylogenetic, and ecogenetic analyses reveal preferential frequented paths (highways) where antibiotic resistance flows and propagates, allowing some understanding of evolutionary dynamics, modeling and designing interventions. Studies on antibiotic resistance have an applied aspect in improving individual health, One Health, and Global Health, as well as an academic value for understanding evolution. Most importantly, they have a heuristic significance as a model to reduce the negative influence of anthropogenic effects on the environment.},

Identifying the constraints imposed by past adaptations is, however, of importance for understanding many questions in evolutionary biology, such as the evolution of host usage dynamics by multi-host viruses or the emergence of escape mutants that persist in the absence of antiviral treatments. To address this issue, we undertook an experimental approach in which sixty lineages of Tobacco etch potyvirus that differ in their past evolutionary history and degree of adaptation to Nicotiana tabacum were allowed to adapt to this host for 15 rounds of within host multiplication and transfer. We thereafter evaluated the degree of adaptation to the new host as well as to the original ones and characterized the consensus sequence of each lineage.},

Here we analyse genome sequences to investigate the history and genetic basis of this trait. At least three distinct clades coexisted for more than 10,000 generations before its emergence. The Cit+ trait originated in one clade by a tandem duplication that captured an aerobically expressed promoter for the expression of a previously silent citrate transporter. The clades varied in their propensity to evolve this novel trait, although genotypes able to do so existed in all three clades, implying that multiple potentiating mutations arose during the population's history. Our findings illustrate the importance of promoter capture and altered gene regulation in mediating the exaptation events that often underlie evolutionary innovations.},

Current theory offers substantial explanatory power, but it overlooks important transient dynamics that are prominent only when populations are outside equilibrium, such as during selective sweeps. We identify a dynamic that we call "adaptive momentum" whereby lineages with a selective advantage can temporarily sustain more deleterious mutations. This reduction in the strength of purifying selection allows populations to explore fitness valleys that are usually too costly to enter, potentially leading to the discovery of otherwise inaccessible fitness peaks. Using mathematical and agent-based simulations, we demonstrate adaptive momentum and show how periods of disequilibrium become windows of enhanced adaptation. Genetic exploration can occur during these windows without requiring mechanisms such as changing environments or complex landscapes. Adaptive momentum provides a simple potential explanation for bursts of rapid evolution observed in nature, including in pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and cancers.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Environmental heterogeneity presents a challenge to microorganisms, as they have to adapt not only to be fit under a specific condition, but they must also be robust across many conditions and be able to deal with the switch between conditions itself . While experimental evolution has been used to gain insight into the adaptive process, this has largely been in either unvarying or consistently varying conditions. In cases where changing environments have been investigated, relatively little is known about how such environments influence the dynamics of the adaptive process itself, as well as the genetic and phenotypic outcomes. We designed a systematic series of evolution experiments where we used two growth conditions that have differing timescales of adaptation and varied the rate of switching between them. We used lineage tracking to follow adaptation, and whole genome sequenced adaptive clones from each of the experiments. We find that both the switch rate and the order of the conditions influences adaptation. We also find different adaptive outcomes, at both the genetic and phenotypic levels, even when populations spent the same amount of total time in the two different conditions, but the order and/or switch rate differed. Thus, in a variable environment adaptation depends not only on the nature of the conditions and phenotypes under selection, but also on the complexity of the manner in which those conditions are combined to result in a given dynamic environment.},

The presence of individual lifetime learning is also known to influence the course of a population's evolution. The experiments reported here, examine the effects that lifetime learning has on the roles played by chance, history and adaptation in the evolution of populations of simple neural networks. The effects of chance, history and adaptation on both learned fitness (fitness after learning) and innate fitness were considered both when learning incurred no cost and when a fitness cost was incurred for learning. When learning was cost-free it was found to decrease the influence of adaptation, history and chance on learned fitness, while having the opposite or possibly no effect on innate fitness. When a fitness cost was incurred for learning, the role of adaptation in determining innate fitness increased, while the roles of chance and history decreased for both learned and innate fitness. These observed effects are interpreted in light prior results on the effects of learning on evolution.},

We subjected digital organisms with each tested architecture to seven different computational environments designed to present a range of evolutionary challenges. Our goal was to engineer a general purpose architecture that would be effective under a broad range of evolutionary conditions. We evaluated six different types of architectural features for the virtual CPUs: (1) genetic flexibility: we allowed digital organisms to more precisely modify the function of genetic instructions, (2) memory: we provided an increased number of registers in the virtual CPUs, (3) decoupled sensors and actuators: we separated input and output operations to enable greater control over data flow. We also tested a variety of methods to regulate expression: (4) explicit labels that allow programs to dynamically refer to specific genome positions, (5) position-relative search instructions, and (6) multiple new flow control instructions, including conditionals and jumps. Each of these features also adds complication to the instruction set and risks slowing evolution due to epistatic interactions. Two features (multiple argument specification and separated I/O) demonstrated substantial improvements in the majority of test environments, along with versions of each of the remaining architecture modifications that show significant improvements in multiple environments. However, some tested modifications were detrimental, though most exhibit no systematic effects on evolutionary potential, highlighting the robustness of digital evolution. Combined, these observations enhance our understanding of how instruction architecture impacts evolutionary potential, enabling the creation of architectures that support more rapid evolution of complex solutions to a broad range of challenges.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Gould's thought experiment of ``replaying life's tape'' provides a conceptual framework for experiments that quantify the contributions of adaptation, chance, and history to evolutionary outcomes. For example, we can empirically measure how varying the depth of history in one environment influences subsequent evolution in a new environment. Can this ``footprint of history''---the genomic legacy of prior adaptation---grow too deep to overcome? Can it constrain adaptation, even with intense selection in the new environment? We investigated these questions using digital organisms. Specifically, we evolved ten populations from one ancestor under identical conditions. We then replayed evolution from three time points in each population's history (corresponding to shallow, intermediate, and deep history) in two new environments (one similar and one dissimilar to the prior environment). We measured the contributions of adaptation, chance, and history to the among-lineage variation in fitness and genome length in both new environments. In both environments, variation in genome length depended largely on history and chance, not adaptation, indicating weak selection. By contrast, adaptation, chance, and history all contributed to variation in fitness. Crucially, whether the depth of history affected adaptation depended on the environment. When the ancestral and new environments overlapped, history was as important as adaptation to the fitness achieved in the new environment for the populations with the deepest history. However, when the ancestral and novel environments favored different traits, adaptation overwhelmed even deep history. This experimental design for assessing the influence of the depth of history is promising for both biological and digital systems.},

Seeding the initial population may be used to improve initial quality and provide a better starting point for the evolutionary algorithm. This must be tempered against the consideration that if the seeding algorithm produces very similar solutions, then the loss of genetic diversity may well lead to a worse final solution. Diversity, we hope, provides a good indication of how good the final solution will be, although only by running the evolutionary algorithm will the exact result be found. We will investigate the effects of heuristic seeding by taking quality and diversity measures of populations generated by heuristic initialization methods on both random and real-life data, as well as assessing the long-term performance of an evolutionary algorithm (found to work well on the timetabling problem) when using heuristic initialization. This will show how the use of heuristic initialization strategies can substantially improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms for the timetabling problem.},

In asexual populations, the identification of beneficial alleles is confounded by the presence of genetically linked hitchhiker mutations. Parallel evolution experiments enable the recognition of common targets of selection; yet these targets are inherently enriched for genes of large target size and mutations of large effect. A comprehensive study of individual mutations is necessary to create a realistic picture of the evolutionarily significant spectrum of beneficial mutations. Here we use a bulk-segregant approach to identify the beneficial mutations across 11 lineages of experimentally evolved yeast populations. We report that nearly 80\% of detected mutations have no discernible effects on fitness and less than 1\% are deleterious. We determine the distribution of driver and hitchhiker mutations in 31 mutational cohorts, groups of mutations that arise synchronously from low frequency and track tightly with one another. Surprisingly, we find that one-third of cohorts lack identifiable driver mutations. In addition, we identify intracohort synergistic epistasis between alleles of hsl7 and kel1 , which arose together in a low-frequency lineage.},

Five feeding groups can be recognized: microbial grazing, deposit-feeding, deposit-feeding/predatory, filter-feeding/predatory, and arthropod tracks and trails. The lower Blueflower Formation (ca. 560--550 Ma) contains abundant burrows that completely cover bedding surfaces with small ({$\sim$}1 mm diameter) cylindrical burrows that were strictly restricted to microbial bedding surfaces and exhibited only primitive and inconsistent avoidance strategies. The upper Blueflower contains three-dimensional avoidance burrows and rare filter-feeding or possibly predatory burrows, suggesting increased behavioral responses in food gathering that marked the beginning of the agronomic revolution in substrate utilization. Cambrian strata of the Ingta Formation contain systematically meandering burrows and more diverse feeding strategies, including the onset of treptichnid probing burrows that may reflect predation. These observations imply that Ediacaran burrowers were largely characterized by crude, two-dimensional avoidance meanders that represented simple behavioral responses of individual burrowers to sensory information, and that the subsequent development of more diverse and complex feeding patterns with genetically programmed search pathways occurred during the earliest stages of the Cambrian explosion. These observations further imply that changes occurred in both the food source and substrate during the ecological transition from Proterozoic matgrounds to Phanerozoic mixgrounds.},

  abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a growing health concern. Efforts to control resistance would benefit from an improved ability to forecast when and how it will evolve. Epistatic interactions between mutations can promote divergent evolutionary trajectories, which complicates our ability to predict evolution. We recently showed that differences between genetic backgrounds can lead to idiosyncratic responses in the evolvability of phenotypic resistance, even among closely related Escherichia coli strains. In this study, we examined whether a strain's genetic background also influences the genotypic evolution of resistance. Do lineages founded by different genotypes take parallel or divergent mutational paths to achieve their evolved resistance states? We addressed this question by sequencing the complete genomes of antibiotic-resistant clones that evolved from several different genetic starting points during our earlier experiments. We first validated our statistical approach by quantifying the specificity of genomic evolution with respect to antibiotic treatment. As expected, mutations in particular genes were strongly associated with each drug. Then, we determined that replicate lines evolved from the same founding genotypes had more parallel mutations at the gene level than lines evolved from different founding genotypes, although these effects were more subtle than those showing antibiotic specificity. Taken together with our previous work, we conclude that historical contingency can alter both genotypic and phenotypic pathways to antibiotic resistance.},

  abstract = {Populations often encounter changed environments that remove selection for the maintenance of particular phenotypic traits. The resulting genetic decay of those traits under relaxed selection reduces an organism's fitness in its prior environment. However, whether and how such decay alters the subsequent evolvability of a population upon restoration of selection for a previously diminished trait is not well understood. We addressed this question using Escherichia coli strains from the long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) that independently evolved for multiple decades in the absence of antibiotics. We first confirmed that these derived strains are typically more sensitive to various antibiotics than their common ancestor. We then subjected the ancestral and derived strains to various concentrations of these drugs to examine their potential to evolve increased resistance. We found that evolvability was idiosyncratic with respect to initial genotype; that is, the derived strains did not generally compensate for their greater susceptibility by ``catching up'' to the resistance level of the ancestor. Instead, the capacity to evolve increased resistance was constrained in some backgrounds, implying that evolvability depended upon prior mutations in a historically contingent fashion. We further subjected a time series of clones from one LTEE population to tetracycline and determined that an evolutionary constraint arose early in that population, corroborating the role of contingency. In summary, relaxed selection not only can drive populations to increased antibiotic susceptibility, but it can also affect the subsequent evolvability of antibiotic resistance in an unpredictable manner. This conclusion has potential implications for public health, and it underscores the need to consider the genetic context of pathogens when designing drug-treatment strategies.},

Ideally, new approaches would target bacterial pathogens while exerting selection for reduced pathogenesis when these bacteria inevitably evolve resistance to therapeutic intervention. As an example of such a management strategy, we isolated a lytic bacteriophage, OMKO1, (family Myoviridae) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that utilizes the outer membrane porin M (OprM) of the multidrug efflux systems MexAB and MexXY as a receptor-binding site. Results show that phage selection produces an evolutionary trade-off in MDR P. aeruginosa, whereby the evolution of bacterial resistance to phage attack changes the efflux pump mechanism, causing increased sensitivity to drugs from several antibiotic classes. Although modern phage therapy is still in its infancy, we conclude that phages, such as OMKO1, represent a new approach to phage therapy where bacteriophages exert selection for MDR bacteria to become increasingly sensitive to traditional antibiotics. This approach, using phages as targeted antibacterials, could extend the lifetime of our current antibiotics and potentially reduce the incidence of antibiotic resistant infections.},

A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks---their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits---but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes.},

Many of these E. coli contribute significantly to the global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Multidrug-resistant (MDR) clones of E. coli have arisen multiple times over varying timescales. The repeated emergence of successful pandemic clones, including the notorious ST131 lineage, highlights a desperate need to further study the evolutionary processes underlying their emergence and success. Here, we review the evolutionary emergence of E. coli ST131 pandemic clones and draw parallels between their evolutionary trajectories and those of other lineages. From colonization and expansion to the acquisition of multidrug resistance plasmids, potentiating mutations are present at each stage, leading to a proposed sequence of events that may result in the formation of an antimicrobial-resistant pandemic clone.},

This has recently changed, as new experimental tools allow the systematic construction and analysis of combinations of predefined sets of genetic mutations.The topography of the fitness landscape is determined by how different mutations interact in their effect on fitness. A particular type of epistasis known as sign epistasis causes the fitness landscape to be rugged, possibly with multiple peaks.A survey of experimental studies shows that most empirical fitness landscapes are rugged, but the amount of ruggedness varies systematically depending on the way the mutations that form the landscape have been chosen.On rugged fitness landscapes, the accessibility of mutational pathways towards higher fitness is reduced, which makes the evolutionary process more constrained and hence predictable. In addition, predictability depends on population size in ways that can be explored using mathematical modelling.A key challenge for the future is to extend current fitness landscape studies to genome-wide scales and to develop models that are informed by the interactions of biomolecules.},

We propose a suite of diagnostic analysis techniques that operate on lineages and phylogenies in digital evolution experiments, with the aim of improving our capacity to quantitatively explore the nuances of evolutionary histories in digital evolution experiments. We present three types of lineage measurements: lineage length, mutation accumulation, and phenotypic volatility. Additionally, we suggest the adoption of four phylogeny measurements from biology: phylogenetic richness, phylogenetic divergence, phylogenetic regularity, and depth of the most-recent common ancestor. In addition to quantitative metrics, we also discuss several existing data visualizations that are useful for understanding lineages and phylogenies: state sequence visualizations, fitness landscape overlays, phylogenetic trees, and Muller plots. We examine the behavior of these metrics (with the aid of data visualizations) in two well-studied computational contexts: (1) a set of two-dimensional, real-valued optimization problems under a range of mutation rates and selection strengths, and (2) a set of qualitatively different environments in the Avida digital evolution platform. These results confirm our intuition about how these metrics respond to various evolutionary conditions and indicate their broad value.},

  abstract = {Microbes often engage in cooperation through releasing biosynthetic compounds required by other species to grow. Given that production of costly biosynthetic metabolites is generally subjected to multiple layers of negative feedback, single mutations may frequently be insufficient to generate cooperative phenotypes. Synergistic epistatic interactions between multiple coordinated changes may thus often underlie the evolution of cooperation through overproduction of metabolites. To test the importance of synergistic mutations in cooperation we used an engineered bacterial consortium of an Escherichia coli methionine auxotroph and Salmonella enterica. S. enterica relies on carbon by-products from E. coli if lactose is the only carbon source. Directly selecting wild-type S. enterica in an environment that favored cooperation through secretion of methionine only once led to a methionine producer, and this producer both took a long time to emerge and was not very effective at cooperating. On the other hand, when an initial selection for resistance of S. enterica to a toxic methionine analog, ethionine, was used, subsequent selection for cooperation with E. coli was rapid, and the resulting double mutants were much more effective at cooperation. We found that potentiating mutations in metJ increase expression of metA, which encodes the first step of methionine biosynthesis. This increase in expression is required for the previously identified actualizing mutations in metA to generate cooperation. This work highlights that where biosynthesis of metabolites involves multiple layers of regulation, significant secretion of those metabolites may require multiple mutations, thereby constraining the evolution of cooperation.},

We divide the rescue task into different sub-tasks: (i) exit the room and enter the double T-maze, (ii) solve the maze to find the teammate, and (iii) guide the teammate safely to the initial room. We evolve controllers for each sub-task, and we combine the resulting controllers in a bottom-up fashion through additional evolutionary runs. We conduct evolution offline, in simulation, and we evaluate the highest performing controller on real robotic hardware. The controller achieves a task completion rate of more than 90\% both in simulation and on real robotic hardware.},

Learning is one of the key processes to acquire information about the environment and adapt to changing and uncertain conditions. Learning has long been acknowledged in animals from invertebrates to vertebrates but remains a subject of debate in non-animal systems such a plants and single cell organisms. In this review I will attempt to answer the following question: are single cell organisms capable of learning? I will first briefly discuss the concept of learning and argue that the ability to acquire and store information through learning is pervasive and may be found in single cell organisms. Second, by focusing on habituation, the simplest form of learning, I will review a series of experiments showing that single cell organisms such as slime molds and ciliates display habituation and follow most of the criteria adopted by neuroscientists to define habituation. Then I will discuss disputed evidence suggesting that single cell organisms might also undergo more sophisticated forms of learning such as associative learning. Finally, I will stress out that the challenge for the future is less about whether or not to single cell organisms fulfill the definition of learning established from extensive studies in animal systems and more about acknowledging and understanding the range of behavioral plasticity exhibited by such fascinating organisms.},

Morphological novelty and innovation has been a recurrent theme. The architects of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory made three claims about evolutionary novelty and innovation: first, that all diversifications in the history of life represent adaptive radiations; second, that adaptive radiations are driven principally by ecological opportunity rather than by the supply of new morphological novelties, thus the primary questions about novelty and innovation focus on their ecological and evolutionary success; and third, that the rate of morphological divergence between taxa was more rapid early in the history of a clade but slowed over time as ecological opportunities declined. These claims have strongly influenced subsequent generations of evolutionary biologists, yet over the past two decades each has been challenged by data from the fossil record, by the results of comparative phylogenetic analyses and through insights from evolutionary developmental biology. Consequently a broader view of novelty and innovation is required. An outstanding issue for future work is identifying the circumstances associated with different styles of diversification and whether their frequency has changed through the history of life.},

Scientists have long tried to predict evolutionary outcomes in order to design vaccines for next year's diseases, stabilize endangered ecosystems, or make better choices in designing evolutionary algorithms. To predict, however, we must first be able to retroactively identify the key steps that determined the evolved state. Researchers have long examined the role of historical contingency in evolution; when do small, seemingly insignificant mutations substantially shift the probabilities of what traits or behaviors ultimately evolve? Practitioners of experimental evolution have recently begun to investigate this question using a new technique: analytic replay experiments. We can found many populations with a given genotype in order to measure the probability of a particular trait evolving from that starting point; we call this the ``potentiation'' of that genotype. Moving along a lineage, we can identify which mutations altered potentiation. Here we used digital organisms to conduct a high-resolution analysis of how individual mutations affected the potentiation of associative learning. We find that the probability of evolving associative learning can increase suddenly -- even with a single mutation that appeared innocuous when it occurred. While there was no obvious signal to identify potentiating mutations as they arose, we were able to retrospectively identify mechanisms by which these mutations influenced subsequent evolution. Many of the most interesting and complex evolutionary adaptations that occur in nature are exceptionally rare. Here, we extend techniques for understanding these rare evolutionary events and the patterns and processes that produce them.},

It is here attempted to ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations {$\sigma$}1 and {$\sigma$}2, it is found that the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard deviation . It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages of the total variance which they together produce. It is desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose phrases about the ``percentage of causation,'' which obscure the essential distinction between the individual and the population, should be carefully avoided.},

Two toxic strains (AL1V and AL2V), previously acclimated for two years at pH 8.0 and 20{$^\circ$}C, were transferred to selective conditions: pH 7.5 to simulate acidification and 25{$^\circ$}C. Cultures under selective conditions were propagated until growth rate and toxin cell quota achieved an invariant mean value at 720 days (ca. 250 and ca. 180 generations for strains AL1V and AL2V, respectively). Historical contingencies strongly constrained the evolution of growth rate and toxin cell quota, but the forces involved in the evolution were not the same for both traits. Growth rate was 1.5--1.6 times higher than the one measured in ancestral conditions. Genetic adaptation explained two-thirds of total adaptation while one-third was a consequence of physiological adaptation. On the other hand, the evolution of toxin cell quota showed a pattern attributable to neutral mutations because the final variances were significantly higher than those measured at the start of the experiment. It has been hypothesized that harmful algal blooms will increase under the future scenario of global change. Although this study might be considered an oversimplification of the reality, it can be hypothesized that toxic blooms will increase but no predictions can be advanced about toxicity.},

  abstract = {To understand how evolving systems bring forth novel and useful phenotypes, it is essential to understand the relationship between genotypic and phenotypic change. Artificial evolving systems can help us understand whether the genotype-phenotype maps of natural evolving systems are highly unusual, and it may help create evolvable artificial systems. Here we characterize the genotype-phenotype map of digital organisms in Avida, a platform for digital evolution. We consider digital organisms from a vast space of 10141 genotypes (instruction sequences), which can form 512 different phenotypes. These phenotypes are distinguished by different Boolean logic functions they can compute, as well as by the complexity of these functions. We observe several properties with parallels in natural systems, such as connected genotype networks and asymmetric phenotypic transitions. The likely common cause is robustness to genotypic change. We describe an intriguing tension between phenotypic complexity and evolvability that may have implications for biological evolution. On the one hand, genotypic change is more likely to yield novel phenotypes in more complex organisms. On the other hand, the total number of novel phenotypes reachable through genotypic change is highest for organisms with simple phenotypes. Artificial evolving systems can help us study aspects of biological evolvability that are not accessible in vastly more complex natural systems. They can also help identify properties, such as robustness, that are required for both human-designed artificial systems and synthetic biological systems to be evolvable.},

  abstract = {We study the structure and properties of adaptive landscapes arising from the assumption that genotype fitness can only be 0 (inviable genotype) or 1 (viable genotype). An appropriate image of resulting (``holey``) fitness landscapes is a (multidimensional) flat surface with many holes. We have demonstrated that in the genotype space there are clusters of viable genotypes whose members can evolve from any member of single substitutions and that there are ``species`` defined according to the biological species concept. Assuming that the number of genes,n, is very large while the proportion of viable genotypes among all possible genotypes,p, is very small, we have deduced many qualitative and quantitative properties of holey adaptive landscapes which may be related to the patterns of speciation. Relationship betweenpandndetermines two qualitatively different regimes: subcritical and supercritical. The subcritical regime takes place ifpis extremely small. In this case, the largest clusters of viable genotypes in the genotype space have size of ordernand there are many of such size; typical members of a cluster are connected by a single (``evolutionary'') path; the number of different (biological) species in the cluster has ordern;the expected number of different species in the cluster withinkviable substitutions from any its member is of orderk. The supercritical regime takes place ifpis small but not extremely small. In this case, there exists a cluster of viable genotypes (a ``giant`` component) that has size of order 2n/n; the giant component comes ``near'' every point of the genotype space; typical members of the giant component are connected by many evolutionary paths; the number of different (biological) species on the ``giant'' component has at least ordern2; the expected number of different species on the ``giant'' component withinkviable substitution from any its member is at least or orderkn. At the boundary of two regimes all properties of adaptive landscapes undergo dramatic changes, a physical analogy of which is a phase transition. We have considered the most probable (within the present framework) scenario of biological evolution on holey landscapes assuming that it starts on a genotype from the largest connected component and proceeds along it by mutation and genetic drift. In this scenario, there is no need to cross any ``adaptive valleys''; reproductive isolation between populations evolves as a side effect of accumulating different mutations. The rate of divergence is very fast: a few substitutions are sufficient to result in a new biological species. We argue that macroevolution and speciation on ``rugged'' fitness landscapes proceed according to the properties of the corresponding holey landscapes.},

Here, we show that the ability to evolve de novo resistance to a clinically important {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotic, ceftazidime, varies drastically across the genus Pseudomonas. This variation arises because strains possessing the ampR global transcriptional regulator evolve resistance at a high rate. This does not arise because of mutations in ampR. Instead, this regulator potentiates evolution by allowing mutations in conserved peptidoglycan biosynthesis genes to induce high levels of {$\beta$}-lactamase expression. Crucially, blocking this evolutionary pathway by co-administering ceftazidime with the {$\beta$}-lactamase inhibitor avibactam can be used to eliminate pathogenic P. aeruginosa populations before they can evolve resistance. In summary, our study shows that identifying potentiator genes that act as evolutionary catalysts can be used to both predict and prevent the evolution of antibiotic resistance.},

  abstract = {Adaptation has been defined and recognized by two different criteria: historical genesis (features built by natural selection for their present role) and current utility (features now enhancing fitness no matter how they arose). Biologists have often failed to recognize the potential confusion between these different definitions because we have tended to view natural selection as so dominant among evolutionary mechanisms that historical process and current product become one. Yet if many features of organisms are non-adapted, but available for useful cooptation in descendants, then an important concept has no name in our lexicon (and unnamed ideas generally remain unconsidered): features that now enhance fitness but were not built by natural selection for their current role. We propose that such features be called exaptations and that adaptation be restricted, as Darwin suggested, to features built by selection for their current role. We present several examples of exaptation, indicating where a failure to conceptualize such an idea limited the range of hypotheses previously available. We explore several consequences of exaptation and propose a terminological solution to the problem of preadaptation.},

  abstract = {The world's most revered and eloquent interpreter of evolutionary ideas offers here a work of explanatory force unprecedented in our time--a landmark publication, both for its historical sweep and for its scientific vision.With characteristic attention to detail, Stephen Jay Gould first describes the content and discusses the history and origins of the three core commitments of classical Darwinism: that natural selection works on organisms, not genes or species; that it is almost exclusively the mechanism of adaptive evolutionary change; and that these changes are incremental, not drastic. Next, he examines the three critiques that currently challenge this classic Darwinian edifice: that selection operates on multiple levels, from the gene to the group; that evolution proceeds by a variety of mechanisms, not just natural selection; and that causes operating at broader scales, including catastrophes, have figured prominently in the course of evolution.Then, in a stunning tour de force that will likely stimulate discussion and debate for decades, Gould proposes his own system for integrating these classical commitments and contemporary critiques into a new structure of evolutionary thought.In 2001 the Library of Congress named Stephen Jay Gould one of America's eighty-three Living Legends--people who embody the "quintessentially American ideal of individual creativity, conviction, dedication, and exuberance." Each of these qualities finds full expression in this peerless work, the likes of which the scientific world has not seen--and may not see again--for well over a century.},

Resistant bacteria can be selected at the high concentrations of antibiotics used therapeutically, but what role the much lower antibiotic concentrations present in many environments plays in selection remains largely unclear. Here we show using highly sensitive competition experiments that selection of resistant bacteria occurs at extremely low antibiotic concentrations. Thus, for three clinically important antibiotics, drug concentrations up to several hundred-fold below the minimal inhibitory concentration of susceptible bacteria could enrich for resistant bacteria, even when present at a very low initial fraction. We also show that de novo mutants can be selected at sub-MIC concentrations of antibiotics, and we provide a mathematical model predicting how rapidly such mutants would take over in a susceptible population. These results add another dimension to the evolution of resistance and suggest that the low antibiotic concentrations found in many natural environments are important for enrichment and maintenance of resistance in bacterial populations.},

  abstract = {The phylogenetic and geographic origins of bats (Chiroptera) remain unknown. The earliest confirmed records of bats date from the early Eocene (approximately 51 Ma) in North America with other early Eocene bat taxa also being represented from Europe, Africa, and Australia. Where known, skeletons of these early taxa indicate that many of the anatomical specializations characteristic of bats had already been achieved by the early Eocene, including forelimb and manus elongation in conjunction with structural changes in the pectoral skeleton, hind limb reorientation, and the presence of rudimentary echolocating abilities. By the middle Eocene, the diversification of bats was well underway with many modern families being represented among fossil forms. A new phylogenetic analysis indicates that several early fossil bats are consecutive sister taxa to the extant crown group (including megabats), and suggests a single origin for the order, at least by the late Paleocene. Although morphological studies have long placed bats in the Grandorder Archonta, (along with primates dermopterans, and tree shrews), recent molecular studies have refuted this hypothesis, instead strongly supporting placement of bats in Laurasiatheria. Primitively, proto-bats were likely insectivorous, under-branch hangers and elementary gliders that exploited terminal branch habitats. Recent work has indicated that a number of other mammalian groups began to exploit similar arboreal, terminal branch habitats in the Paleocene, including multituberculates, eulipotyphlans, dermopterans, and plesiadapiforms. This may offer an ecological explanation for morphological convergences that led to the erroneous inclusion of bats within Archonta: ancestral archontan groups as well as proto-bats apparently were exploiting similar arboreal habitats, which may have led to concurrent development of homoplasic morphological attributes.},

It also provides the ultimate explanation for why any protein has the properties it has today.Biochemical approaches illuminate core questions in molecular evolution because they can reveal the mechanisms by which historical mutations led to the emergence of new phenotypes, they can characterize the topology of the genotype--function space on which evolution occurred, and they can illuminate how the physical properties of biological molecules shaped the evolutionary processes.Work in evolutionary biochemistry explains the interplay of contingency and determinism in molecular evolution as the result of the specific functional constraints and genetic interactions that are produced by the physical architecture of each protein.},

  abstract = {In genetic programming systems, parent selection algorithms select the programs from which offspring will be produced by random variation and recombination. While most parent selection algorithms select programs on the basis of aggregate performance on multiple test cases, the lexicase selection algorithm considers each test case individually, in random order, for each parent selection event. Prior work has shown that lexicase selection can produce both more diverse populations and more solutions when applied to several hard problems. Here we examine the effects of lexicase selection, compared to those of the more traditional tournament selection algorithm, on population error diversity using two program synthesis problems. We conduct experiments in which the same initial population is used to start multiple runs, each using a different random number seed. The initial populations are extracted from genetic programming runs, and fall into three categories: high diversity populations, low diversity populations, and populations that occur after diversity crashes. The reported data shows that lexicase selection can maintain high error diversity and also that it can re-diversify less-diverse populations, while tournament selection consistently produces lower diversity.},

Previous work has shown that it can also produce hyperselection events, in which a single individual is selected many more times than other individuals. Here we investigate the role that hyperselection plays in the problem-solving performance of lexicase selection. We run genetic programming on a set of program synthesis benchmark problems using lexicase and tournament selection, confirming that hyperselection occurs significantly more often and more drastically with lexicase selection, which also performs significantly better. We then show results from an experiment indicating that hyperselection is not integral to the problem-solving performance or diversity maintenance observed when using lexicase selection. We conclude that the power of lexicase selection stems from the collection of individuals that it selects, not from the unusual frequencies with which it sometimes selects them.},

Many highly convergent adaptations are also complex, which makes their repeated emergence surprising. In plants, the evolutionary history of two carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) --- C4 and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis --- presents such a paradox. Both of these modifications of ancestral C3 photosynthesis require the integration of multiple anatomical and biochemical components, yet together they have evolved more than one hundred times. The presence of CCM enzymes in all plants suggests that a rudimentary CCM might emerge via relatively few genetic changes in potentiated lineages. Here, we propose that many of the complexities often associated with C4 and CAM photosynthesis may have evolved during a post-emergence optimization phase. The ongoing development of new model clades for young, emerging CCMs is enabling the comparative studies needed to test these ideas.},

We first examine the limits of modality by constructing a unimodal function and a maximally multimodal function. At such extremes our intuition breaks down. A fitness landscape consisting entirely of a single hill leading to the global optimum proves to be harder for hillclimbers than GAs. A provably maximally multimodal function, in which half the points in the search space are local optima, can be easier than the unimodal, single hill problem for both hillclimbers and GAs. Exploring the more realistic intermediate range between the extremes of modality, we construct local optima with varying degrees of ``attraction'' to our evolutionary algorithms. Most work on optima and their basins of attraction has focused on hills and hillclimbers, while some research has explored attraction for the GA's crossover operator. We extend the latter results by defining and implementing maximal partial deception in problems with k arbitrarily placed global optima. This allows us to create functions, such as the minimum distance function fmdG, with k isolated global optima and multiple local optima attractive to both crossover and hillclimbers. The function fmdG seems to be a powerful new tool for generalizing deception and relating hillclimbers (and Hamming space) to GAs and crossover.},

  abstract = {Multicellularity spans a wide gamut in terms of complexity, from simple clonal clusters of cells to large-scale organisms composed of differentiated cells and tissues. While recent experiments have demonstrated that simple forms of multicellularity can readily evolve in response to different selective pressures, it is unknown if continued exposure to those same selective pressures will result in the evolution of increased multicellular complexity. We use mathematical models to consider the adaptive trajectories of unicellular organisms exposed to periodic bouts of abiotic stress, such as drought or antibiotics. Populations can improve survival in response to the stress by evolving multicellularity or cell differentiation---or both; however, these responses have associated costs when the stress is absent. We define a parameter space of fitness-relevant traits and identify where multicellularity, differentiation, or their combination is fittest. We then study the effects of adaptation by allowing populations to fix mutations that improve their fitness. We find that while the same mutation can be beneficial to phenotypes with different complexity, e.g. unicellularity and differentiated multicellularity, the magnitudes of their effects can differ and alter which phenotype is fittest. As a result, we observe adaptive trajectories that gain and lose complexity. We also show that the order of mutations, historical contingency, can cause some transitions to be permanent in the absence of neutral evolution. Ultimately, we find that continued exposure to a selective driver for multicellularity can either lead to increasing complexity or a return to unicellularity.},

We use in vitro experimental evolution and whole-genome sequencing of colistin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients to reconstruct the molecular evolutionary pathways open for high-level colistin resistance. We show that the evolution of resistance is a complex, multistep process that requires mutation in at least five independent loci that synergistically create the phenotype. Strong intergenic epistasis limits the number of possible evolutionary pathways to resistance. Mutations in transcriptional regulators are essential for resistance evolution and function as nodes that potentiate further evolution towards higher resistance by functionalizing and increasing the effect of the other mutations. These results add to our understanding of clinical antimicrobial peptide resistance and the prediction of resistance evolution.},

  abstract = {Introduced species often exhibit changes in genetic variation, population structure, selection regime and phenotypic traits as they colonize and expand into new ranges. For these reasons, species invasions are increasingly recognized as promising systems for studying adaptive evolution over contemporary time scales. However, changes in phenotypic traits during invasion occur under non-equilibrium demographic conditions and may reflect the influences of prior evolutionary history and chance events, as well as selection. We briefly review the evidence for phenotypic evolution and the role of selection during invasion. While there is ample evidence for evolutionary change, it is less clear if selection is the primary mechanism. We then discuss the likelihood that stochastic events shift phenotypic distributions during invasion, and argue that hypotheses of adaptation should be tested against appropriate null models. We suggest two experimental frameworks for separating stochastic evolution from adaptation: statistically accounting for phenotypic variation among putative invasion sources identified by using phylogenetic or assignment methods and by comparing estimates of differentiation within and among ranges for both traits and neutral markers (QST vs. FST). Designs that incorporate a null expectation can reveal the role of history and chance in the evolutionary process, and provide greater insights into evolution during species invasions.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary theory predicts that a population in a new environment will accumulate adaptive substitutions, but precisely how they accumulate is poorly understood. The dynamics of adaptation depend on the underlying fitness landscape. Virtually nothing is known about fitness landscapes in nature, and few methods allow us to infer the landscape from empirical data. With a view toward this inference problem, we have developed a theory that, in the weak-mutation limit, predicts how a population's mean fitness and the number of accumulated substitutions are expected to increase over time, depending on the underlying fitness landscape. We find that fitness and substitution trajectories depend not on the full distribution of fitness effects of available mutations but rather on the expected fixation probability and the expected fitness increment of mutations. We introduce a scheme that classifies landscapes in terms of the qualitative evolutionary dynamics they produce. We show that linear substitution trajectories, long considered the hallmark of neutral evolution, can arise even when mutations are strongly selected. Our results provide a basis for understanding the dynamics of adaptation and for inferring properties of an organism's fitness landscape from temporal data. Applying these methods to data from a long-term experiment, we infer the sign and strength of epistasis among beneficial mutations in the Escherichia coli genome.},

We used experimental evolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to quantify this contingency, finding differences in adaptability among 64 closely related genotypes. Despite these differences, sequencing of 104 evolved clones showed that initial genotype did not constrain future mutational trajectories. Instead, reconstructed combinations of mutations revealed a pattern of diminishing-returns epistasis: Beneficial mutations have consistently smaller effects in fitter backgrounds. Taken together, these results show that beneficial mutations affecting a variety of biological processes are globally coupled; they interact strongly, but only through their combined effect on fitness. As a consequence, fitness evolution follows a predictable trajectory even though sequence-level adaptation is stochastic.},

The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways---one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the `extended evolutionary synthesis' (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism--environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.},

Here we undertake a synthesis of central concepts for evolutionary predictions, based on examples of microbial and viral systems, cancer cell populations, and immune receptor repertoires. These systems have strikingly similar evolutionary dynamics driven by the competition of clades within a population. These dynamics are the basis for models that predict the evolution of clade frequencies, as well as broad genetic and phenotypic changes. Moreover, there are strong links between prediction and control, which are important for interventions such as vaccine or therapy design. All of these are key elements of what may become a predictive theory of evolution.},

However, successfully evolving such cognitive abilities remains difficult. This paper argues that a main cause for such difficulty is deception, i.e. evolution converges to a behavior unrelated to the desired solution. More specifically, cognitive behaviors often require accumulating neural structure that provides no immediate fitness benefit, and evolution often thus converges to non-cognitive solutions. To investigate this hypothesis, a common evolutionary robotics T-Maze domain is adapted in three separate ways to require agents to communicate, remember, and learn. Indicative of deception, evolution driven by objective-based fitness often converges upon simple non-cognitive behaviors. In contrast, evolution driven to explore novel behaviors, i.e. novelty search, often evolves the desired cognitive behaviors. The conclusion is that open-ended methods of evolution may better recognize and reward the stepping stones that are necessary for cognitive behavior to emerge.},

Although Minimal Cognition has occasionally used Pavlovian methods to try to demonstrate Associative Learning, neither the Psychology of Learning nor the Comparative Psychology traditions are prominent in the movement. However, the Psychology of Learning approach, with its highly sophisticated experimental designs, has done a great deal of research on Associative Learning in animals and carried out several studies on plants and unicellular organisms. The present work offers a comprehensive review of these experimental results, among invertebrates, plants and unicellular organisms (paramecia and the amoeba Physarum policephalum) showing that, while there are increasing instances of Associative Learning in many invertebrate phyla (and also many phyla with no data) there is no adequate evidence of it in unicellular protists (despite more than a century of experiments with paramecia and amoeba) or in plants (despite recent results that so claim). We then consider the alternative offered by Minimal Cognition and suggest some complementary ideas, from a Comparative Developmental Psychology approach, which we call ``Minimal Development.''

Yet, the question remains for many of these studies if, given identical starting populations, evolution in the wild proceeds in a non-random direction. In the present study, we investigated the extent to which rapid evolution in the wild is parallel by monitoring the genetic composition of replicate populations of Daphnia in field mesocosms containing two clonal genotypes. We found parallel changes across all nine mesocosms, in which the same genotype increased in frequency. To probe whether genotype-specific response to resource abundance could have led to this frequency change, we conducted a life-history assay under high-resource abundance and low-resource abundance. We found that resource exploitation differed by genotype, in that, while one genotype (the winner in the field mesocosms) was more fit than the other genotype at high resources, the other genotype performed slightly better at low resources. We suspect that levels of resource abundance found in the summer field mesocosms had values in which the genotype better with abundant resources had the advantage. These findings suggest that variation in certain traits associated with resource acquisition can drive genotype frequency change.},

  abstract = {Real-world optimisation problems are often very complex. Metaheuristics have been successful in solving many of these problems, but the difficulty in choosing the best approach can be a huge challenge for practitioners. One approach to this dilemma is to use fitness landscape analysis to better understand problems before deciding on approaches to solving the problems. However, despite extensive research on fitness landscape analysis and a large number of developed techniques, very few techniques are used in practice. This could be because fitness landscape analysis in itself can be complex. In an attempt to make fitness landscape analysis techniques accessible, this paper provides an overview of techniques from the 1980s to the present. Attributes that are important for practical implementation are highlighted and ways of adapting techniques to be more feasible or appropriate are suggested. The survey reveals the wide range of factors that can influence problem difficulty, emphasising the need for a shift in focus away from predicting problem hardness towards measuring characteristics. It is hoped that this survey will invoke renewed interest in the field of understanding complex optimisation problems and ultimately lead to better decision making on the use of appropriate metaheuristics.},

Although often referred to as silent mutations, evidence suggests that synonymous mutations can affect gene expression, mRNA stability, and even translation efficiency. A collection of both experimental and bioinformatic data has shown that synonymous mutations can impact cell phenotype, yet less is known about the molecular mechanisms and potential of beneficial or adaptive effects of such changes within evolved populations. Here, we report a beneficial synonymous mutation acquired via experimental evolution in an essential gene variant encoding the translation elongation factor protein EF-Tu. We demonstrate that this particular synonymous mutation increases EF-Tu mRNA and protein levels as well as global polysome abundance on RNA transcripts. Although presence of the synonymous mutation is clearly causative of such changes, we also demonstrate that fitness benefits are highly contingent on other potentiating muta\- tions present within the genetic background in which the mutation arose. Our results underscore the importance of beneficial synonymous mutations, especially those that affect levels of proteins that are key for cellular processes.},

While associative learning -- the ability to detect correlated features of the environment -- has been studied extensively in nervous systems, where the underlying mechanisms are reasonably well understood, mechanisms within single cells that could allow associative learning have received little attention. Here, using in silico evolution of chemical networks, we show that there exists a diversity of remarkably simple and plausible chemical solutions to the associative learning problem, the simplest of which uses only one core chemical reaction. We then asked to what extent a linear combination of chemical concentrations in the network could approximate the ideal Bayesian posterior of an environment given the stimulus history so far? This Bayesian analysis revealed the `memory traces' of the chemical network. The implication of this paper is that there is little reason to believe that a lack of suitable phenotypic variation would prevent associative learning from evolving in cell signalling, metabolic, gene regulatory, or a mixture of these networks in cells.},

To visualize this genetic programming run, the ancestry graph is extracted, running from the solution(s) in the final generation up to their ancestors in the initial random population. The key instructions in the solution are also identified, and a genetic ancestry graph is constructed, a subgraph of the ancestry graph containing only those individuals that contributed genetic information (or instructions) to the solution. These visualizations and our ability to trace these key instructions throughout the run allow us to identify general inheritance patterns and key evolutionary moments in this run.},

Here we report experimental evolution of learning ability in Drosophila melanogaster. We exposed experimental populations for 51 generations to conditions that we expected to favor associative learning with regard to oviposition substrate choice. Flies that learned to associate a chemical cue (quinine) with a particular substrate, and still avoided this substrate several hours after the cue had been removed, were expected to contribute more alleles to the next generation. From about generation 15 on, the experimental populations showed marked ability to avoid oviposition substrates that several hours earlier had contained the chemical cue. The improved response to conditioning was also expressed when the flies were faced with a choice of novel media. We demonstrate that these behavioral changes are caused by the evolution of both a higher learning rate and a better memory.},

Emerging ML/AI-oriented hardware accelerators, like the 850,000 processor Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE), hold particular promise. However, practical challenges remain in conducting informative evolution experiments that efficiently utilize these platforms' large processor counts. Here, we focus on the problem of extracting phylogenetic information from agent-based evolution on the WSE platform. This goal drove significant refinements to decentralized in silico phylogenetic tracking, reported here. These improvements yield order-of-magnitude performance improvements. We also present an asynchronous island-based genetic algorithm (GA) framework for WSE hardware. Emulated and on-hardware GA benchmarks with a simple tracking-enabled agent model clock upwards of 1 million generations a minute for population sizes reaching 16 million agents. We validate phylogenetic reconstructions from these trials and demonstrate their suitability for inference of underlying evolutionary conditions. In particular, we demonstrate extraction, from wafer-scale simulation, of clear phylometric signals that differentiate runs with adaptive dynamics enabled versus disabled. Together, these benchmark and validation trials reflect strong potential for highly scalable agent-based evolution simulation that is both efficient and observable. Developed capabilities will bring entirely new classes of previously intractable research questions within reach, benefiting further explorations within the evolutionary biology and artificial life communities across a variety of emerging high-performance computing platforms.},

To overcome this lack of fitness gradient, we propose to efficiently explore behaviors until the evolutionary process finds an individual with a non-minimal fitness. To that aim, we introduce an original diversity-preservation mechanism, called behavioral diversity, that relies on a distance between behaviors (instead of genotypes or phenotypes) and multi-objective evolutionary optimization. This approach has been successfully tested and compared to a recently published incremental evolution method (multi-subgoal evolution) on the evolution of a neuro-controller for a light-seeking mobile robot. Results obtained with these two approaches are qualitatively similar although the introduced one is less directed than multi-subgoal evolution.},

Our earlier work on real-time learning suffered from the drawback of the learning time being limited by the response dynamics of the robot's environment. In order to overcome this problem we have devised a new technique which allows learning from past experiences that are stored in memory. The new method shows its advantage when perfect behavior emerges in experiments quickly and reliably. It is tested on two control tasks, obstacle avoiding and wall following behavior, both in simulation and on the real robot platform Khepera.},

All pink salmon mature at age two and die after breeding. Hence, pink salmon bred in even years are completely reproductively isolated from those bred in odd years, even if the two lineages bred in same location. We used time series (mean = 7 years, maximum = 74 years) of paired even- and odd-year populations from 36 rivers spanning over 2000 km to explore parallelism in migration timing, a trait with a strong genetic basis. Migration timing was highly parallel, being determined almost entirely by local environmental differences among rivers. Interestingly, interannual changes in migration timing different somewhat between lineages. Overall, our findings indicate very strong determinism, with only a minor contribution of contingency.},

In order to be able to predict evolutionary outcomes (even on the short term), we must know more about the nature of realistic fitness landscapes than we do today. For example, in order to know whether evolution is predominantly taking paths that move upwards in fitness and along neutral ridges, or else entails a significant number of valley crossings, we need to be able to visualize these landscapes: we must determine whether there are peaks in the landscape, where these peaks are located with respect to one another, and whether evolutionary paths can connect them. This is a difficult task because genetic fitness landscapes (as opposed to those based on traits) are high-dimensional, and tools for visualizing such landscapes are lacking. In this contribution, we focus on the predictability of evolution on rugged genetic fitness landscapes, and determine that peaks in such landscapes are highly clustered: high peaks are predominantly close to other high peaks. As a consequence, the valleys separating such peaks are shallow and narrow, such that evolutionary trajectories towards the highest peak in the landscape can be achieved via a series of valley crossings.},

Here, we review recent experimental progress in areas as different as the evolution of drug resistance in cancer cells and the rewiring of transcriptional regulation circuits in vertebrates. This research reveals the importance of three major themes: multiple genetic and non-genetic mechanisms to generate phenotypic diversity, robustness in genetic systems, and adaptive landscape topography. We also discuss the mounting evidence that evolvability can evolve and the question of whether it evolves adaptively.},

Using experimental evolution, we show that key steps in this transition could have occurred quickly. We subjected the unicellular yeast               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               to an environment in which we expected multicellularity to be adaptive. We observed the rapid evolution of clustering genotypes that display a novel multicellular life history characterized by reproduction via multicellular propagules, a juvenile phase, and determinate growth. The multicellular clusters are uniclonal, minimizing within-cluster genetic conflicts of interest. Simple among-cell division of labor rapidly evolved. Early multicellular strains were composed of physiologically similar cells, but these subsequently evolved higher rates of programmed cell death (apoptosis), an adaptation that increases propagule production. These results show that key aspects of multicellular complexity, a subject of central importance to biology, can readily evolve from unicellular eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {Evolution is often deemed irreversible. The evolution of complex traits that require many mutations makes their reversal unlikely. Even in simpler traits, reversals might become less likely as neutral or beneficial mutations, with deleterious effects in the ancestral context, become fixed in the novel background. This is especially true in changes that involve large reorganizations of the organism and its interactions with the environment. The evolution of multicellularity involves the reorganization of previously autonomous cells into a more complex organism; despite the complexity of this change, single cells have repeatedly evolved from multicellular ancestors. These repeated reversals to unicellularity undermine the generality of Dollo's law. In this article, we evaluated the dynamics of reversals to unicellularity from recently evolved multicellular phenotypes of the brewers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae. Even though multicellularity in this system evolved recently, it involves the evolution of new levels of selection. Strong selective pressures against multicellularity lead to rapid reversibility to single cells in all of our replicate lines, whereas counterselection favoring multicellularity led to minimal reductions to the rates of reversal. History and chance played an important role in the tempo and mode of reversibility, highlighting the interplay of deterministic and stochastic events in evolutionary reversals.},

  abstract = {History, chance, and selection are the fundamental factors that drive and constrain evolution. We designed evolution experiments to disentangle and quantify effects of these forces on the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Previously, we showed that selection of the pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii in both structured and unstructured environments containing the antibiotic ciprofloxacin produced distinct genotypes and phenotypes, with lower resistance in biofilms as well as collateral sensitivity to {$\beta$}-lactam drugs (Santos-L\- opez et al., 2019). Here we study how this prior history influences subsequent evolution in new {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotics. Selection was imposed by increasing concentrations of ceftazidime and imipenem and chance differences arose as random mutations among replicate populations. The effects of history were reduced by increasingly strong selection in new drugs, but not erased, at times revealing important contingencies. A history of selection in structured environments constrained resistance to new drugs and led to frequent loss of resistance to the initial drug by genetic reversions and not compensatory mutations. This research demonstrates that despite strong selective pressures of antibiotics leading to genetic parallelism, history can etch potential vulnerabilities to orthogonal drugs.},

We collected data over one thousand randomly generated problems. We then simulated collecting expert knowledge for each problem by optimizing an approximated version of the exact solution. We then compared six different methods of seeding the approximate model in to the genetic program, such as using the entire approximate model at once or breaking it into pieces. Contrary to common intuition, we found that inserting the complete expert solution into the population is not the best way to utilize that information; using parts of that solution is often more effective. Additionally, we found that each method scaled differently based on the complexity and accuracy of the approximate solution. Inserting randomized pieces of the approximate solution into the population scaled the best into high complexity problems and was the most invariant to the accuracy of the approximate solution. Furthermore, this method produced the least bloated solutions of all methods. In general, methods that used randomized parameter coefficients scaled best with the approximate error, and methods that inserted entire approximate solutions scaled worst with the problem complexity.},

Despite their success, GAs sometimes fail to locate the highest peaks of the fitness landscape, in particular if the landscape is rugged and contains multiple peaks. Reaching distant and higher peaks is difficult because valleys need to be crossed, in a process that (at least temporarily) runs against the fitness maximization objective. Here we propose and test a number of information-theoretic (as well as network-based) measures that can be used in conjunction with a fitness maximization objective (so-called ``neuro-correlates'') to evolve neural controllers for two widely different tasks: a behavioral task that requires information integration, and a cognitive task that requires memory and logic. We find that judiciously chosen neuro-correlates can significantly aid GAs to find the highest peaks.},

While a number of studies have shown the applicability of evolutionary robotics techniques for the synthesis of behavioral control, researchers have consistently been faced with a number of issues preventing the widespread adoption of evolutionary robotics for engineering purposes. In this article, we review and discuss the open issues in evolutionary robotics. First, we analyze the benefits and challenges of simulation-based evolution and subsequent deployment of controllers versus evolution on real robotic hardware. Second, we discuss specific evolutionary computation issues that have plagued evolutionary robotics: (1) the bootstrap problem, (2) deception, and (3) the role of genomic encoding and genotype-phenotype mapping in the evolution of controllers for complex tasks. Finally, we address the absence of standard research practices in the field. We also discuss promising avenues of research. Our underlying motivation is the reduction of the current gap between evolutionary robotics and mainstream robotics, and the establishment of evolutionary robotics as a canonical approach for the engineering of autonomous robots.},

We analyse the real-time evolution of               Drosophila subobscura               populations derived from contrasting European latitudes placed in a novel laboratory environment. Each natural population was sampled twice within a three-year interval. We study evolutionary responses at both phenotypic (life-history, morphological and physiological traits) and karyotypic levels for around 30 generations of laboratory culture. Our results show (1) repeatable historical effects between years in the initial state, at both phenotypic and karyotypic levels; (2) predictable phenotypic evolution with general convergence except for body size; and (3) unpredictable karyotypic evolution. We conclude that the predictability of evolution is contingent on the trait and level of organization, highlighting the importance of studying multiple biological levels with respect to evolutionary patterns.},

Differences in phylogenetic history, recent adaptation to distinct environments and chance events, all influence the fitness of a population. However, the interplay of these factors on a population's evolutionary potential remains relatively unexplored. We tracked the outcome of 2000 generations of evolution of four natural isolates of Escherichia coli bacteria that were engineered to also create differences in shallow history by adding previously identified mutations selected in a separate long-term experiment. Replicate populations started from each progenitor evolved in four environments. We found that deep and shallow phylogenetic histories both contributed significantly to differences in evolved fitness, though by different amounts in different selection environments. With one exception, chance effects were not significant. Whereas the effect of deep history did not follow any detectable pattern, effects of shallow history followed a pattern of diminishing returns whereby fitter ancestors had smaller fitness increases. These results are consistent with adaptive evolution being contingent on the interaction of several evolutionary forces but demonstrate that the nature of these interactions is not fixed and may not be predictable even when the role of chance is small.},

  abstract = {We describe the content and outcomes of the First Workshop on Open-Ended Evolution: Recent Progress and Future Milestones (OEE1), held during the ECAL 2015 conference at the University of York, UK, in July 2015. We briefly summarize the content of the workshop's talks, and identify the main themes that emerged from the open discussions. Two important conclusions from the discussions are: (1) the idea of pluralism about OEE---it seems clear that there is more than one interesting and important kind of OEE; and (2) the importance of distinguishing observable behavioral hallmarks of systems undergoing OEE from hypothesized underlying mechanisms that explain why a system exhibits those hallmarks. We summarize the different hallmarks and mechanisms discussed during the workshop, and list the specific systems that were highlighted with respect to particular hallmarks and mechanisms. We conclude by identifying some of the most important open research questions about OEE that are apparent in light of the discussions. The York workshop provides a foundation for a follow-up OEE2 workshop taking place at the ALIFE XV conference in Canc{\'u}n, Mexico, in July 2016. Additional materials from the York workshop, including talk abstracts, presentation slides, and videos of each talk, are available at http://alife.org/ws/oee1 .},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have noted that the evolution of new enzymatic specificities is accompanied by loss of the protein's thermodynamic stability ({$\Delta\Delta$}G), thus suggesting a tradeoff between the acquisition of new enzymatic functions and stability. However, since most mutations are destabilizing ({$\Delta\Delta$}G{$>$}0), one should ask how destabilizing mutations that confer new or altered enzymatic functions relative to all other mutations are. We applied {$\Delta\Delta$}G computations by FoldX to analyze the effects of 548 mutations that arose from the directed evolution of 22 different enzymes. The stability effects, location, and type of function-altering mutations were compared to {$\Delta\Delta$}G changes arising from all possible point mutations in the same enzymes. We found that mutations that modulate enzymatic functions are mostly destabilizing (average {$\Delta\Delta$}G = +0.9 kcal/mol), and are almost as destabilizing as the ``average'' mutation in these enzymes (+1.3 kcal/mol). Although their stability effects are not as dramatic as in key catalytic residues, mutations that modify the substrate binding pockets, and thus mediate new enzymatic specificities, place a larger stability burden than surface mutations that underline neutral, non-adaptive evolutionary changes. How are the destabilizing effects of functional mutations balanced to enable adaptation? Our analysis also indicated that many mutations that appear in directed evolution variants with no obvious role in the new function exert stabilizing effects that may compensate for the destabilizing effects of the crucial function-altering mutations. Thus, the evolution of new enzymatic activities, both in nature and in the laboratory, is dependent on the compensatory, stabilizing effect of apparently ``silent'' mutations in regions of the protein that are irrelevant to its function.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY In experimental evolution, laboratory-controlled conditions select for the adaptation of species, which can be monitored in real time. Despite the current popularity of such experiments, nature's most pervasive biological force was long believed to be observable only on time scales that transcend a researcher's life-span, and studying evolution by natural selection was therefore carried out solely by comparative means. Eventually, microorganisms' propensity for fast evolutionary changes proved us wrong, displaying strong evolutionary adaptations over a limited time, nowadays massively exploited in laboratory evolution experiments. Here, we formulate a guide to experimental evolution with microorganisms, explaining experimental design and discussing evolutionary dynamics and outcomes and how it is used to assess ecoevolutionary theories, improve industrially important traits, and untangle complex phenotypes. Specifically, we give a comprehensive overview of the setups used in experimental evolution. Additionally, we address population dynamics and genetic or phenotypic diversity during evolution experiments and expand upon contributing factors, such as epistasis and the consequences of (a)sexual reproduction. Dynamics and outcomes of evolution are most profoundly affected by the spatiotemporal nature of the selective environment, where changing environments might lead to generalists and structured environments could foster diversity, aided by, for example, clonal interference and negative frequency-dependent selection. We conclude with future perspectives, with an emphasis on possibilities offered by fast-paced technological progress. This work is meant to serve as an introduction to those new to the field of experimental evolution, as a guide to the budding experimentalist, and as a reference work to the seasoned expert.},

If so, then Darwinian evolution may help create the conditions that enable Darwinian evolution. Here I propose a framework that is suitable to address this question with available experimental data on adaptive landscapes. I introduce the notion of an evolvability-enhancing mutation, which increases the likelihood that subsequent mutations in an evolving organism, protein, or RNA molecule are adaptive. I search for such mutations in the experimentally characterized and combinatorially complete fitness landscapes of a protein and an RNA molecule. I find that such evolvability-enhancing mutations indeed exist. They constitute a small fraction of all mutations, which shift the distribution of fitness effects of subsequent mutations towards less deleterious mutations, and increase the incidence of beneficial mutations. Evolving populations which experience such mutations can evolve significantly higher fitness. The study of evolvability-enhancing mutations opens many avenues of investigation into the evolution of evolvability.},

However, we demonstrate that 102 trajectories are inaccessible to Darwinian selection and that many of the remaining trajectories have negligible probabilities of realization, because four of these five mutations fail to increase drug resistance in some combinations. Pervasive biophysical pleiotropy within the {$\beta$}-lactamase seems to be responsible, and because such pleiotropy appears to be a general property of missense mutations, we conclude that much protein evolution will be similarly constrained. This implies that the protein tape of life may be largely reproducible and even predictable.},

We compile the largest database of global nodulating plant species and reconstruct the symbiosis' evolution. We identify a single, cryptic evolutionary innovation driving symbiotic N2-fixation evolution, followed by multiple gains and losses of the symbiosis, and the subsequent emergence of `stable fixers' (clades extremely unlikely to lose the symbiosis). Originating over 100 MYA, this innovation suggests deep homology in symbiotic N2-fixation. Identifying cryptic innovations on the tree of life is key to understanding the evolution of complex traits, including symbiotic partnerships.},

The concept of a deceptive attractor is introduced and shown to be more general than the deceptive optimum found in the deceptive functions that have been constructed to date. Also introduced are the concepts of fully deceptive problems as well as less strict consistently deceptive problems. A proof is given showing that deceptive attractors must have a complementary bit pattern to that found in the binary representation of the global optimum if a function is to be either fully deceptive or consistently deceptive.

  abstract = {Cryptic genetic variation can facilitate adaptation in evolving populations. To elucidate the underlying genetic mechanisms, we used directed evolution in Escherichia coli to accumulate variation in populations of yellow fluorescent proteins and then evolved these proteins toward the new phenotype of green fluorescence. Populations with cryptic variation evolved adaptive genotypes with greater diversity and higher fitness than populations without cryptic variation, which converged on similar genotypes. Populations with cryptic variation accumulated neutral or deleterious mutations that break the constraints on the order in which adaptive mutations arise. In doing so, cryptic variation opens paths to adaptive genotypes, creates historical contingency, and reduces the predictability of evolution by allowing different replicate populations to climb different adaptive peaks and explore otherwise-inaccessible regions of an adaptive landscape.},
