% Discussion
% This section may be divided by subheadings. Discussions should cover the key findings of the study: discuss any prior research related to the subject to place the novelty of the discovery in the appropriate context, discuss the potential shortcomings and limitations on their interpretations, discuss their integration into the current understanding of the problem and how this advances the current views, speculate on the future direction of the research, and freely postulate theories that could be tested in the future.

\section{Discussion}
% Discussion outline
    % Large single-step potentiation gains are common, but not ubiquitous
        % Median > 35%, Mean > 40%
        % Some jumps are as large as 80%
        % However, we also see instances as low as 20%
        % How many are significiant?

    % These potentiating events are overwhelmingly driven by single mutations
        % 30/50 were just one mutation to start with, 14 more seem to be driven by one mutation 

    % Still no metrics to detect potentiating mutations as they occur
        % Fitness effects can be anything
        % Only a few (7/50) change the behavioral phenotype
Here we place the results of this work in a broader evolutionary biology context. 

\subsection{Drastic increases in potentiation are common}

\subsection{Single mutations often drive increases in potentiation}

\subsection{Mutation interactions influence potentiation}

\subsection{Potentiating mutations are still undetectable in an evolving population}
