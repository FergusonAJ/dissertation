\noindent This chapter is in final preparation before submission.

This chapter directly extends the previous chapter. 
We expand from analyzing the potentiation dynamics of four case study lineages to replaying 50 lineages.
With this larger dataset, we begin to conduct statistically powerful analyses of the the distribution of potentiation changes. 
In all 50 lineages we find a single-generation step in the lineage where the potentiation of associative learning increases significantly. 
Further, we verify that these increases are most often driven by a single mutation, though we do find evidence that multiple mutations can interact to increase potentiation. 
We find that these large potentiation increases are comparable to some, but not all, previous works on potentiation, and discuss those comparisons in detail.

% Status: This is a direct extension of Chapter \ref{chap:alife_submission}.
% It is marked in-progress as all software has been implemented and additional explorations beyond Chapter \ref{chap:alife_submission} have been conducted to identify useful changes to parameters and the environment. 
% The actual data collection, however, has yet to begin. 
% Note that this chapter may make Chapter \ref{chap:alife_submission} redundant in the final dissertation.
% Both are included here, however, as Chapter \ref{chap:alife_submission} serves as preliminary results for this chapter.
