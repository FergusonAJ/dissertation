% If your system does not generate letter format documents by default,

% latex example ; latex example
% dvips -o example.ps -t letterSize example.dvi
% ps2pdf example.ps example.pdf


% For pdflatex users:
% The alifeconf style file loads the "graphicx" package, and
% this may lead some users of pdflatex to experience problems.
% These can be fixed by editing the alifeconf.sty file to specify:
% \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
%   instead of
% \usepackage{graphicx}.
% The PDF output generated by pdflatex should match the required

\noindent This chapter is adapted from a paper that has been peer-reviewed and accepted to appear in the proceedings of the 2024 Conference on Artificial Life. 

In this work we use the lens of historical contingency and potentiation to provide a new vantage point in understanding the adaptive momentum effect. 
According to the adaptive momentum framework, when a population is in disequilibrium some advantaged organisms can buffer more deleterious mutations than usual. 
This increased buffering increases evolutionary exploration until equilibrium is reestablished. 
Here we replay the evolution of select populations evolving in an idealized environment: a one-dimensional sawtooth function.
At each step we are able to quantify their potential to cross the next deleterious fitness valley. 
We find that populations experiencing disequilibrium, here caused by a selective sweep, see their potential to cross increase drastically with mutations near the leading edge of the sweep. 
Conversely, populations in equilibrium rely purely on chance to cross -- only the last mutations before a valley cross confer an increase in potential. 
Finally, we also performed ``shuffled'' replays to demonstrate that the structure of the population, not just its genetic makeup, is key in increased valley-crossing potential in this system.
